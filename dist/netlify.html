In Netlify’s Dashboard, you need to connect <a href="https://www.netlify.com/blog/2016/09/29/a-step-by-step-guide-deploying-on-netlify/">the new repository to a new site in Netlify</a>.</p><p>Once that’s hooked up, you need to tell Netlify how to build your Jackyll project. In the dashboard, head to: Settings &gt; Build &amp; Deploy &gt; Build Settings. In this area, we need to change your “Build command” to “node index.js” and your “Publish directory” to “./dist” (or whatever your output directory is called).</p><p>Next, you can set up a webhook so that Netlify will publish the site upon changes to the Sanity CMS.</p><p>To do that, set up a Webhook to notify Netlify to rebuild. A Webhook is a URL that can be programmatically accessed by a different service (such as Sanity) to create an action in the origin service (in this case Netlify).</p><p>You can set up a specific “Build hook” in your Netlify dashboard at Settings &gt; Build &amp; Deploy &gt; Build hooks. Add a hook, give it a name and save. This will provide a URL that can be used to remotely trigger a build in Netlify.</p><p>Next, you need to tell Sanity to make a request to this URL when you publish changes.</p><p>You can use the Sanity CLI to accomplish this. Inside of your <code>/studio</code> directory, you can run <code>sanity hook create</code> to connect. The command will ask for a name, a dataset, and a URL. The name can be whatever you’d like, the dataset should be <code>production</code> for your product, and the URL should be the URL that Netlify provided.</p><p>I think that's it?</p></div> </p> </article> <aside > <ul >

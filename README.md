A basic static site generator

Check out the lil' site I made with it for some more info. -> https://jackal-static-generator.netlify.app/

I'm pretty happy with where this ended up. The compiler works well and I learned a bit about several different things. I actually created a simple site with it too! So I'm gonna set this one aside and work on some other project.
